# Basic-Trading-App

Basic boilerplate app for fully automated algorithmic trading

1. Risk management logic goes into RiskManager.py
2. Exchange integrations go into Clients.py
3. Any logic related to trade execution (e.g. buying/selling) goes into Services.py

If you have an FTX account feel free to enter your API keys/secret into the config and see if it works. You should be able to run this on multiple exchanges. 

If any help is needed with the set-up feel free to contact me at xaes@pm.me
